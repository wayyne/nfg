This software has non-standard dependencies, we recommend setting up a python virtual enviroment that satisfies the dependencies. Specificially, numpy and gdal with osgeo are required. Numpy installation is straight-forward; for osgeo installation see: https://gdal.org/api/python_bindings.html

Software is provided as is, a manuscript detailing the implementation, use-cases, and modularity, along with a user-manual, is in preperation.
